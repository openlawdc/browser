Law 17-249 rewrote the section, which had read as follows:\n\n\"(a) If an incapacitated individual has no guardian, a life threatening emergency exists, and no other person appears to have authority to act within the circumstances, the court, on appropriate petition, may appoint a temporary guardian whose authority may not extend beyond 15 days and who may exercise those powers granted in the order. Immediately upon receipt of the petition, counsel shall be appointed for the individual alleged to be incapacitated and notice provided to the individual alleged to be incapacitated and to interested persons, pursuant to section 21-2042. The individual alleged to be incapacitated, counsel for that individual, or any other interested person may request a hearing at any time within the period of the temporary guardianship. The hearing shall be held no later than 48 hours after the request.\n\n\"(b) If the court finds that an appointed guardian is not effectively performing duties and that the welfare of the incapacitated individual requires immediate action, it may appoint, with notice to interested parties within 14 days after the appointment, a temporary guardian for the incapacitated individual. This temporary guardian shall have the powers set forth in the previous order of appointment for a specified period not to exceed 6 months.
