The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C.

Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.\n\nMiscellaneous Notes\n\nAppropriations authorized: Public Law 103-334, 108 Stat. 2581, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act, 1995, provided for construction projects $5,600,000, as authorized by §§ 34-2405.01 through 34-2405.08; §§ 34-2413.08 and 34-2413.10; including acquisition of sites, preparation of plans and specifications, conducting preliminary surveys, erection of structures, including building improvement and alteration and treatment of grounds, to remain available until expended: Provided, That $140,000 shall be available for project management and $110,000 shall be available for design by the Director of the Department of Public Works or by contract for architectural engineering services, as may be determined by the Mayor: Provided further, That funds for use of each capital project implementing agency shall be managed and controlled in accordance with all procedures and limitations established under the Financial Management System: Provided further, That all funds provided by this appropriation title shall be available only for the specific projects and purposes intended: Provided further, That notwithstanding the foregoing, all authorizations for capital outlay projects, except those projects covered by the first sentence of section 23(a) of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968, approved August 23, 1968 (82 Stat. 827; Public Law 90- 495; D.C.
